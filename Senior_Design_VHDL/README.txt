This code is part of a 2018 senior design project by Neil Olson and Alan Coe. 

Project: 1-channel oscilloscope

Project goals: 
- Design and fabricate a custom oscilloscope circuit board
- Write VHDL to process incoming signals and drive a VGA display

State of the code (4/20/2022): 
The VHDL code does work, but it is semi-finished. There are some picture issues with the display, and 
some of the user controls remain unused.
